Wallace and I took a look at it together on 6/17/2020 and think it may be due to how the planter/tractor was calibrated that day. We had expected the planting density to be enough to evenly
fill a plot 20 ft long (and the tractor tire marks are for 20ft long plots), but it seems that the planting  density is only enough to evenly fill about 16.5 ft of each plot.
